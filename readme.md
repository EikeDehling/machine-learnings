# Machine learnings - Basics of machine learning

Last year i followed a coursera course on machine learning and several courses on
statistics and data analysis. After that i've started participating in kaggle
machine learning competitions, first tutorial competitions and now also some
serious competitions.

In here i'll share an overview of what i've learned and give links to code snippets
that you can reuse. I'm hoping this is interesting and helpfull to others that are
starting to learn about this subject!


## Overview

There is several important activities in a machine learning effort, often it starts
at some exploratory data analysis, there can be data preparation, feature engineering
and preprocessing. Then comes selecting and tuning models. Finally there is evaluation
of the completed model.

I've tried to display the process in the chart below:

The picture intends to show that there is a back-and-forth between the various
activities. Often it all starts at exploratory analysis and then trying to make a
basic model, leading to a first score. Then the result is improved from there
by revisiting each of the steps, for example adding some more features tuning the
model more, picking a stronger model etc.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
## Data Preparation
## Feature engineering
## Preprocessing (scaling/normalization ; transforms ; feature selection ; ...)
## Cross validation
## Tuning model(s) parameters
## Comparing and choosing between model(s)
## Conclusions
