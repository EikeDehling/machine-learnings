# Machine learnings - Basics of machine learning

Last year i followed a coursera course on machine learning and several courses on
statistics and data analysis. After that i've started participating in kaggle
machine learning competitions, first tutorial competitions and now also some
serious competitions.

In here i'll share an overview of what i've learned and give links to code snippets
that you can reuse. I'm hoping this is interesting and helpfull to others that are
starting to learn about this subject!


## Overview

Basic process is...

- EDA
- Data preparation
- Feature engineering
- Preprocessing (scaling/normalization ; transforms ; feature selection ; ...)
- Cross validation
- Tuning model(s) parameters
- Comparing and choosing between model(s)
- Ensembling ?
